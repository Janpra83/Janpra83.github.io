	<p><b>David Kirk, (Treasurer)</b><br /><br />

Dave Kirk is a retired Physics Teacher who learnt some of the challenges that face the children of the poor in Tamil Nadu when visiting the area annually over a period of more than twenty years. He has often seen the conditions in which a great many tribal families live and realises the very few choices that the children have after they leave what is usually a very short schooling. In Awake he sees there can be a bright future for these children, and therefore a brighter future for their families. He hopes that HAPsI can continue to be a stable and very active supporter of our sister Indian charity for many years and can eventually spread its influence into the tribal villages of the Palani Hills.

I have been teaching for 13 years and am currently Headteacher of a large primary school in Folkestone, Kent. I first visited Southern India in 2003 with Canterbury Christ Church University and immediately fell in love with the people, culture and customs. I have returned four times since. Each time I received such a warm welcome from the Awake Mercy Home and renewed passion for supporting the deserving children who are cared for so expertly there.

<b>Glenn Sharp (Chairman)</b>
<br /><br />
I am a full-time Primary School teacher and Senior Leader at Sandgate Primary School. On my friend Dr. Stephen Scoffham's recommendation, I took a few days to visit the Awake Trust, whilst on holiday in South India in March 2005. During these memorable days, I was humbled by the specialness of the home created by Krishna and Elizi which was for around 24 children at that time. It was exactly that: a home! Not an institution; but a place where the children were treated as members of one family; with love, care, warmth, respect and able to flourish. On one of my subsequent visits I was also lucky enough to meet my wife Jancy, whose family home is in the same district. We now look forward to the visits to the home as a family, with our two young children.

I am recently qualified primary school teacher, having completed my PGCE last summer. My involvement with HAPsI arose on the back of a dinner conversation with Stephen Scoffham during a teaching trip to South India in 2016. He talked with great enthusiasm about his relationship with the Awake Mercy Home and the fantastic and tireless work Krishna and Elsie do. I mentioned to Stephen that I would love to visit the home and offer my assistance as a teacher.� I did not think anything would come of it but 6 months later, there I was, teaching lessons and playing games with the wonderful children . It is happy, vibrant and often chaotic place but also one of the warmest.� I hope that becoming a trustee will allow me to support Awake Mercy in enabling it to continue providing a much needed safe and nurturing environment for the children who live there.�

I first became involved in Awake Mercy on a visit to Tamil Nadu with David Kirk, my husband�s life-long friend. The atmosphere in the house was just that � homely. The children are well cared-for, well-nourished and most importantly, well-loved. Krishna and Elsie are inspirational and their 30+ children are happy, contented, polite, delightful young people.
In view of the excellent work Krishna and Elsie do on a daily basis, I felt that the least I could do was to help in any way possible. Becoming a Trustee and helping to raise funds for the continuation and development of Awake Mercy is my contribution.
