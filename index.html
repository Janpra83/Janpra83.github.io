			<h1>Welcome to HAPsI</h1>

	<p>HAPsI is dedicated to helping poor children in South India.
We have helped to build a children's home, which has now been running for over 10 years.
There are currently over 50 children, many of whom are from remote tribal areas.
When you donate to HAPsI, you give children from disadvantaged communities opportunities to build a new life.
Wherever possible, we work with the Indian government and local agencies.

The Awake Mercy Home was founded in 2002 to provide family style care and support for a small number of needy children.
The home now houses over 50 children and includes a school, gardens and a well-used playing area.
It is administered by Krishna Moorthi and Elsie.
There is some support with clothes, food and stationary from sponsors in the local community.
HAPsI's support is crucial in enabling the Awake Mercy Home to met its running costs.
It is an <a href="award-winning.html" title="Award winning home">Award winning home</a> for the outstanding quality of its provision.<br /><br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Janpra83/MyFiles/master/images/building-new1.jpg" alt="New building for Awake" border="1" /></p>
