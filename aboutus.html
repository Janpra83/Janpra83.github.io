			<h1>About Us !</h1>

	<p>To advance the education and to relieve the need of the children of
      the Awake Mercy Trust, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, by promoting and assisting,
      financially or otherwise, the charitable activities carried out by that
      trust.</p>

      <p>To advance education and relieve the need among young people in
      South India who are affected by poverty, disability or environmental
      difficulties.</p>

      <p>To foster rural development in tribal village communities in Tamil
      Nadu in order to work towards self sufficiency and sustainability in those
      communiities. This work aims to alleviate the problems faced at present
      without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
      needs.</p>

      <p>HAPsI aims to raise money through its present supporters who know the
      conditions and problems in the area in which Awake Trust works, and also
      wishes to expand its supporter base in UK, Ireland and France.</p>

      <p>Its administration costs are at present being donated freely to the
      charity, so that any funds raised will all be available for financing
      projects in India.
