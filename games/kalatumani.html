             <h1>Instructions</h1>
<ul class="bulletli"><li>
The game is to played with 2 teams (A & B) of equal numbers (from 4 to 15 members each).
Each team has to select its own captain.
The two captains have to confer and each decide a different category for their team.
Categories could include: colours, fruits, vegetables, animals, film stars, sports etc.
The captain has to name every member of his team individually within their chosen category.
So if a captain decides on Animals as a category, he could give his team members names such as: Cat, Dog, Parrot, Peacock, Lion, Tiger, Elephant etc.
Each team keeps it own individual names secret from each other.
The captains have no individual name themselves.</li><li>

The two teams sit in a line opposite each other with their legs facing each other.
The game begins when Team A's captain comes and kneels behind a child in Team B, chosen by Team B.</li><li>
Team A's captain will gently put his hands over the eyes of the chosen child to prevent
him seeing anything.</li><li>
From this time on , all the other children who are sitting shake their legs and hands, chanting the words KALATTUMANI KAIYATTUMANI, which means: SHAKE LEGS, SHAKE HANDS.
Team A's captain calls one of his/her team members by their secret name and this member
will come and lightly touch the head of the chosen child of Team B.
The child from Team A who has touched the head returns to his/her place.
When this child is sitting comfortably back in his/her place, Team A's captain releases his/her hands from the child from Team B and all the children stop chanting.
The child from Team B has to make a guess as to who has touched him/her.</li><li>

A point is gained for a correct answer, although each of the other children must keep
this secret and can't give any clues or hints until the true identity is guessed. Only one guess is allowed !</li><li>
The game continues with Team B now taking turns.
