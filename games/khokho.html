             <h1>Instructions</h1>
<p class="text_9">(with specific numbers indicated , although there is a lot of flexibility within these & this game works well with any even number of players between 20 and 30)</p>

              <ul class="bulletli">
<li>Play Kho Kho in 2 teams of 12, in a field that measures approx 30 m by 15 m.</li>
<li>Start with 8 members of the "chasing" team sitting or kneeling in a row in the middle of the court, with alternate members in the row facing opposite directions. Two wooden poles/ chairs stand at either end of this central line. The ninth player is the "chaser," and he takes his position next to one of the two poles.</li>
<li>Send 3 members of the other team onto the court. These defenders, or dodgers, can be dismissed in three ways: getting touched (with the palm) by a chaser, going out of the limits, or entering the limit late.</li>
<li>Run in one direction only if you are a chaserï¿½you cannot reverse course. You also cannot cut across the central line of sitters, even though the dodgers may run wherever they like. Chasers have to run around the entire row.</li>
<li>Pass off the chasing to another sitter, whose back must be facing you. The chaser touches the sitter while loudly shouting "kho." After the first set of 3 defenders is caught, the next batch of 3 is sent onto the field.</li>
</ul>
